Hey Vivek, how are you ? 
 
We have new project to be hosted on AKS - the request coming from 2ns Image this time
 
Interested ? 
 
Hey Peter, I am doing well. How about u ?
 
yeah, sure. can you give me a bit more context on what project involves 
 
I'm doing great
 
Sure, David sent me a request - https://helpme.ontellus.com/app/itdesk/ui/requests/128659000091714185/details
 
I don't have access to the help desk system, so he mentioned that he needs help to host this app https://bitbucket.org/keaisdev/si/src/master/ on AKS
 
Which includes creating deployment dockerfile, HELM chart and CI / CD Azure pipelines
 
I'm still discovering about the project itself, like the tech stack, deployment type .. etc 
 
I found that we had Java docker images ceated long time ago to host MyO portal on AKS https://bitbucket.org/keaisdev/my-keais/src/71c035518b7a2472daa0190982e9ed2fd59b2de4/docker/builder/?at=myo-portal-upgrade-aks
 
Sure, Thank you. I will have a look at it
 
Awesome, please ask me any thing at any time, i'll advise to start with building a docker file locally
 
Also i'm working on a POC for workload identity and will share it with you very soon 
 
great, Thank you
